A Rust implementation of set-based [interval arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic).

## Requirements

### `rustc` version

A recent version of the nightly toolchain is required, since the [new `asm!` macro](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/06/08/new-inline-asm.html) is used. You need to specify the toolchain by, for example, the [toolchain file](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) in your crate (see [example](https://github.com/unageek/inari-graph/blob/master/rust-toolchain)).

### Target CPUs

- x86-64

  Haswell-based or newer processors are supported. You need to specify the target CPU by, for example, the [Cargo configuration file](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html) in your crate (see [example](https://github.com/unageek/inari-graph/blob/master/.cargo/config.toml); you may want to change `native` to `haswell` for maximum compatibility if you are going to distribute your binary).

- AArch64 (a.k.a. ARM64)

  Experimental, it is not tested continuously.

## Conditional features

- `gmp` (enabled by default) - Enables operations that depend on GMP and MPFR, namely, transcendental functions and conversion between texts and intervals. You can opt-out the feature to reduce dependencies. Even in that case, you still have access to all arithmetic operations that are required for writing filters for robust geometric predicates.
